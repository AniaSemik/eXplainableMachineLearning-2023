# Trustworthy Machine Learning / Wyja≈õnialne Uczenie Maszynowe - 2023

Lecture notes for 'Trustworthy Machine Learning' at [UoW](https://usosweb.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&amp;kod=1000-319bEML). Winter semester 2022/2023


# Design Principles

The course consists of lectures, computer labs and a project.

The design of this course is based on four principles:

- Mixing experiences during studies is good. It allows you to generate more ideas. Also, in mixed groups, we can improve our communication skills,
- In XAI, the interface/esthetic of the solution is important. XAI, like earlier HCI (Human Computer Interaction), is on the borderline between technical, domain and cognitive aspects. Therefore, apart from the purely technical descriptions, the results must be grounded in the domain and are communicated aesthetically and legibly, 
- communication of results is important. Both in science and business, it is very important to be able to present the results concisely and legibly. In this course, it should translate into the ability to describe one XAI story in the form of a short chapter/article.
- It is worth doing useful things. Let's look for new applications for XAI methods discussed on typical predictive problems.

# Presentations

Presentations can be prepared by one or two students. Each group should present a single XAI related paper (journal or conference). Each group should choose a different paper. Here are some suggestions.
